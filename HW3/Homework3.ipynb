    "In this homework you will build a full neural machine translation system using an attention-based encoder-decoder network to translate from German to English. The encoder-decoder network with attention forms the backbone of many current text generation systems. See [Neural Machine Translation and Sequence-to-sequence Models: A Tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01619.pdf) for an excellent tutorial that also contains many modern advances.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a non-attentional baseline model (pure seq2seq as in [ref](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf)). \n",
    "2. Incorporate attention into the baseline model ([ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) but with dot-product attention as in class notes).\n",
    "3. Implement beam search: review/tutorial [here](http://www.phontron.com/slides/nlp-programming-en-13-search.pdf)\n",
    "4. Visualize the attention distribution for a few examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consult the papers provided for hyperparameters, and the course notes for formal definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be the most time-consuming assignment in terms of difficulty/training time, so we recommend that you get started early!"

    "Now we split our data into batches as usual. Batching for MT is slightly tricky because source/target will be of different lengths. Fortunately, `torchtext` lets you do this by allowing you to pass in a `sort_key` function. This will minimizing the amount of padding on the source side, but since there is still some padding you will inadvertendly \"attend\" to these padding tokens. \n",
